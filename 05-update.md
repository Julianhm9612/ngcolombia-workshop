# Updating objects from our database

In the previous lesson we learned how to store data in Firestore. Now, it's time to learn how to read that data and display it inside our application.

This time we're going to do things a little different, instead of starting with the logic, we're going to start with the view, even if we need to hardcode the data, and then replace it with dynamic data.

We'll work like this because we want you to have feedback from the begining, and be able to see what you're building.
